					<li>In 1995 he invented and <a href="p&p/risk.pdf" style="color:blue">published</a> the now ubiquitous risk adjusted Net Present Value (raNPV, a/k/a eNPV) methodology for valuing early stage drugs and drug companies.</li><br>
					<li>The <a href="https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html" style="color:blue">World Intellectual Property Organization</a> retained him to create the <a href="https://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/doc_details.jsp?doc_id=332588" style="color:blue">Intellectual Property Valuation Manual for Academic Institutions</a> which was published by WIPO in 2016.</li>
				</ul>
